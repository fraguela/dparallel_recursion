## Dparallel_recursion </p>

This library provides a framework to parallelize algorithms that follow a divide-and-conquer pattern. Its two main components are the skeletons `parallel_recursion` and `dparallel_recursion`. The first one parallelizes the required algorithm using multithreading within a single process. The second skeleton supports the parallelization across hybrid memory environments such as clusters of nodes with multi-core processors as well as multiple processes on top of the MPI standard.

### Installation

 Please read the accompanying `INSTALL.md` file.
 
### Examples and documentation

- The `benchmarks` and `tests` directories contain implementations of algorithms with very different nature using the library and execising all its features.

- Running `make doc` in the `doc directory` builds a user-level documenation based on Doxygen. A more detailed documentation can be built by running `make internal-doc`.

- The `parallel_recursion` skeleton and its supporting classes are described and compared with other alternatives in the publication [A Generic Algorithm Template for Divide-and-conquer in Multicore Systems](http://www.des.udc.es/~basilio/papers/hpcc10.pdf) ([DOI 10.1109/HPCC.2010.24](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/HPCC.2010.24)).

- The `dparallel_recursion` skeleton is described and compared with other alternatives in the publication [A general and efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm framework for multi-core clusters](http://www.des.udc.es/~basilio/papers/Gonzalez17-cluster.pdf) ([DOI 10.1007/s10586-017-0766-y](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10586-017-0766-y)).

- The `parallel_stack_recursion` skeleton is described and compared with other alternatives in the publication [A Parallel Skeleton for Divide-and-conquer Unbalanced and Deep Problems](http://www.des.udc.es/~basilio/papers/Martinez21-DaC.pdf) ([DOI 10.1007/s10766-021-00709-y](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10766-021-00709-y)).

- The `dparallel_stack_recursion` skeleton is described and compared with other alternatives in the publication "A highly optimized skeleton for Unbalanced and Deep Divide-and-conquer Algorithms on Multi-core Clusters", not yet published.
